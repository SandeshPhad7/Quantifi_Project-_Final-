Anonymous,,Just wow!,It's my honest review after using this cooler for one year. I live in the top floor of a building at Rangia in Assam. Room size is 14 by 13 feet. In a hot night of May or June I use 3 litres of cool fridge water and some ice cubes with normal water and towards the late night I need to take a blanket or to switch off it. Proper ventilation should be maintained. It consumes low electricity and also inverter friendly. Can go for it without any hesitation.,
Anonymous,,Very Good,I'm satisfied.,
Anonymous,,Really Nice,"Received in a proper condition.... build quality is not so great... working fine as of now , don't know how it will work in summer ....will use it for some more time and edit my review",
Anonymous,,Must buy!,Very nice product firstly I hesitate to buy it bcz most of the coolers will have water leakage problem from anyone side of its pads we have experienced it before buying this one but honestly I am writing this review after the usage of 10days there is no any problem yet now and most of the coolers makes sound but it has less one when compared to other brands don't get hesitate just go for it..,
Anonymous,,Wonderful,"Cooler is awesome airflow amazing, power consumption is also low inverter can take up the load easily, but sometimes the water leaks from the side but not too much, so overall it is good",

Anonymous,,Nice product,"Our room is exactly 10x10 and we are two people. The room is well ventilated, so in this room, for 2 people, even for 3 people this cooler is enough. A stand to elevate its height can be better for cooler but we don't have, so we simply put the vents in the upward direction and it throws air to both of us. Air throw is definitely 9ft if not more. The water inlet is pretty wide and we use one full bucket water to fill directly and it doesn't pour out. U can even add ice into it. Separate ice chamber not there. Wheels are good. Cable is short -this issue is true with every cooler I guess. Water indicator level is good. Consumption is more I guess. 45litre is enough for 8hrs and then half and hour in afternoon but not more than that.

If u have keep it beside ur bed or workstation, and room is well ventilated...go for this. This cooler is very good for 2 3people sleeping on one bed or working in a room or even kitchen.",

Anonymous,,Fair,"According to price the cooler is justified. I will say not that great but good.
Few observations
1 - cooler was licking.
2- it is smelling really bad while using.
3- it’s noise level is high compare to speed.
4- air throw is max till 3 feet.

Overall it is okay with price.. can be used for small room and single person.",

Anonymous,,Great product,The product is awesome.. First you have to understand the difference between the air cooler and air conditioner. It cools my medium size room perfectly within 1 hour. Every cooler has a little noise like celling fan at high speed.. & you have to open the door or windows for cross ventilation so that it can work properly. The size is compact. Air flow is very good. I just love it & thanks Flipkart for door step Delevary on time..,
Anonymous,,Best in the market!,Super good for room when window is open,
Anonymous,,Good quality product,"Cooling effect is good no doubt only when the surrounding wind flow is good too. But product material is not strong, need to be very careful while moving on floor and opening the windows to clean tank. Should be handel carefully. Price wise good for bachelor's nd couples staying in compact flat. While running not too much noisy but air flow is good till 7ft and covers good amount of area. But not sure if it can help to cool on peak summer like April May June, that will be challenging.",

Anonymous,3.9,Great product,"Good cooler, works fine and looks good. Water tank capacity is quite sufficient. Good air throw. Swing option works well. To get good air breeze, ventilation is must - which is common for all coolers. Power consumption is only 105W, which is a plus point. Overall good selection.",
Anonymous,,Worth the money,"Before buying this i saw many reviews about water leakage.. But i must tell you,there is very minimal leakage... If u r ordering this for ur personal room in hostel,or you leaving outside home,then it's totally fine... Even if u buy this for home,i don't think so that,the leakage prblm affect that much.. so i suggest you to go for it ...",
Anonymous,,Best in the market!,"Just koolin-awesome... Perfect for small n medium rooms. Just put a big ice cube in the water from back panel and wallah feel the snowcrest like cool effect. But needed good ventilation of windows and doors or else humidity wil stick like salt on your skin. Minor side water leakage can be solved by pushing the upper side of honey comb slightly inside. Stand with wheels could have been a best option instead. Loved the product, the design, the plastic body, the air flow and the reasonable price.",

Anonymous,,Awesome,Good one..,
Anonymous,,Brilliant,Nice Cooler suitable for small & medium size room for 3-4 persons. Cooler looks premium and weightless you can easily move. Air flow is average and cooling system is good. If you have small and medium size room this cooler is enough don't buy big size coolers(that takes more place and difficult to move). Inside it is having fan not blower that is one advantage fan always give good air flow compare to blower.At this price range this is the best cooler for medium size room for 3-4 persons.,

Anonymous,,Mind-blowing purchase,"Bought this product on 6th May 2021. Flipkart delivered it on 10th May 2021. Product received 2 days before the scheduled delivery that too in lockdown period. Packaging was good and product came a brand new.
I was looking for a personal cooler and i must say hindware cooler does his job very nicely. Cooling is great at this size of cooler. Water tank is sufficient. All you need is to keep cooler in a room and create ventilation to enjoy best cooling experience. Look wise cooler is super cute and very easy to keep it because of its tiny size. Great product. Must recommend to buy this summer and enjoy cooling.
If it would have ice chamber too that would be an plus for this cooler but without ice chamber also it does its job very well.",

Anonymous,,Slightly disappointed,leakage in water,
Anonymous,,Value-for-money,"Cooler is consist of one fan ,one submersible pump ,three side honeycomb pad,one water tank and some electrical circuits. Don't expect too much cooling , it's just a cooling fan. The cooler cools to a specific area,it will not cool the room.This much amount for these component is high.it could be in between 2500 to 3500. However, under 6000 this product is better than most of the cooler available in the market. The product I got is bent from two sides.",
Anonymous,,Really Nice,"4 out of 5 Design.
4 out of 5 noise
5 out of 5 tank capacity. Sufficient capacity for two days of water.
5 out of 5 Air throw
3 out of 5 ice chamber
4 out of 5 cooling. The main reason is honeycomb pads are not enough dense.

Overall good purchase. I am satisfied.
You can go with this.",
Anonymous,,Worth the money,"First week:
Enough sturdy, good fan and cooling capacity for small to medium sized rooms. Not for halls or large rooms. It says 45 litres but I think it's lesser thought of rating a star less for this but didn't do it as it serves the purpose.
Second week:
Leakage problem starts
No option to remove, replace, clean or adjust sides as the option to do so is not available, only rear side is detachable. Final verdict not recommended because of undetachable sides. A good product with major defect.
Third week:
Water leakage stopped automatically, but one drawback with is side pads are not detachable.",

Soo it needs more height......",

got this cooler within a day of booking. cooling is good and cools 160 Sq FT area easily in 15 mins.. good for medium size room...

ice chamber should have been provided...
I m mostly using on speed 1 and still provides good air throw.. on high speed noise level also increases..
overall plastic quality is good.
hoping it would last long and less repair and maintenance is required..

Noise perspective Minimum because it uses fan not the blower.
Pump works good,
Opertatng knobs works great, touch n feel is also very good.
Then comes to Air throw, We have been using speed 1 and throws air upto 10 feet easily.so think of top speed.
And finally comes to performance wise cooling the air is good not great, don't expect too much from aircoolers in this hot summer..but as middle class we expect too much in minimum budget range..
So I suggest no turn around just go for it, it's absolute beast in its own range.",
