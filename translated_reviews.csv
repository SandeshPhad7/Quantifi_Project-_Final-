,It's my honest review after using this cooler for one year. I live in the top floor of a building at Rangia in Assam. Room size is 14 by 13 feet. In a hot night of May or June I use 3 litres of cool fridge water and some ice cubes with normal water and towards the late night I need to take a blanket or to switch off it. Proper ventilation should be maintained. It consumes low electricity and also inverter friendly. Can go for it without any hesitation.,It's my honest review after using this cooler for one year.

,"Our room is exactly 10x10 and we are two people. The room is well ventilated, so in this room, for 2 people, even for 3 people this cooler is enough. A stand to elevate its height can be better for cooler but we don't have, so we simply put the vents in the upward direction and it throws air to both of us. Air throw is definitely 9ft if not more. The water inlet is pretty wide and we use one full bucket water to fill directly and it doesn't pour out. U can even add ice into it. Separate ice chamber not there. Wheels are good. Cable is short -this issue is true with every cooler I guess. Water indicator level is good. Consumption is more I guess. 45litre is enough for 8hrs and then half and hour in afternoon but not more than that.

If u have keep it beside ur bed or workstation, and room is well ventilated...go for this.

So I suggest no turn around just go for it, it's absolute beast in its own range.",en
